Dear {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for your application to join an apprenticeship with BPP.

As part of the onboarding process and adherence to the Apprenticeship funding rules and criteria, we require you to book a review call with a member of our Apprenticeship team. This call is currently showing as outstanding on our records and whilst you may be on program and have had a Welcome call already you do still need to complete this call.

What you need to do next

You now need to set up a quick 10 minute video call to:

Discuss your eligibility, prior experience, and knowledge
Make sure the apprenticeship matches your job needs and is the right programme for you
Check your ID documents

Book your application review call here.

Ideally you need to attend with your line manager, but if you cannot align your diaries then we can continue with you and send any documentation to your line manager for agreement once the call has taken place. If you are attending the call with your line manager, please forward them the call invite.

Important: You must arrange this call before you can start your apprenticeship programme. The call will be conducted using Microsoft Teams, however if you can only use Zoom please email once you have booked the call in and we will amend the Teams call to a Zoom call for you.

Preparing for your call

After you&apos;ve chosen a time, you just need to prepare a few things for your meeting:

Make sure you&apos;ve signed in to your BPP Hub account
Check your learning plan here before the call
For identity verification, have your camera on during the call
Have your passport, driver&apos;s licence, or any photo ID for verification

If you need support

Call 03300 603 443
Email apprenticeshiponboarding@bpp.com
