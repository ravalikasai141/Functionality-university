Dear {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for your application to join an apprenticeship with BPP.

As part of the onboarding process and adherence to the Apprenticeship funding rules and criteria, we require you to book a review call with a member of our Apprenticeship team.

What you need to do next

You now need to set up a quick 15 minute video call to:

Discuss your eligibility, prior experience, and knowledge
Make sure the apprenticeship matches your job needs and is the right programme for you
Check your ID documents
Book your application review call here.
Once booked, you&apos;ll receive a confirmation message which will ask you to forward the invite to your line manager. You don&apos;t need to do this as your employer is centrally signing off your application.

Important: Important: You must arrange this call before you can start your apprenticeship programme.

Preparing for your call

After you&apos;ve chosen a time, you just need to prepare a few things for your meeting:

The call will be on Microsoft Teams. You can download Teams for free here
Make sure you&apos;ve signed in to your BPP Hub account
Check your learning plan here before the call
For identity verification, have your camera on during the call
Have your passport, driver&apos;s licence, or any photo ID for verification
