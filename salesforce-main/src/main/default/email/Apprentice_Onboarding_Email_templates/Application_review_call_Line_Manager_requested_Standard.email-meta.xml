Dear {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for your application to join an apprenticeship with BPP.

As part of the onboarding process and adherence to the Apprenticeship funding rules and criteria, we require you to book a review call with a member of our Apprenticeship team.

What you need to do next

You now need to set up a quick 15 minute video call to:

Discuss your eligibility, experience, and knowledge
Make sure the apprenticeship matches your job needs
Check your ID documents

Book your application review call here.

Important: You must arrange and attend this call before you can start your apprenticeship programme. Ideally you need to attend with your line manager, but if you cannot align your diaries then we can continue with you and send any documentation to your line manager for agreement once the call has taken place. If you are attending the call with your line manager, please forward them the call invite.

Preparing for your call

After you&apos;ve chosen a time, you just need to prepare a few things for your meeting:

The call will be on Microsoft Teams. You can download Teams for free here
Make sure you&apos;ve signed in to your BPP Hub account
Check your learning plan here before the call
For identity verification, have your camera on during the call
Have your passport, driver&apos;s licence, or any photo ID for verification

If you need support

If you have any questions, please contact us today.
