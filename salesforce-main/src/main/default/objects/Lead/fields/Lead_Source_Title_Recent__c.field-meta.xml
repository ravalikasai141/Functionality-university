    <description>This field has been introduced due to the integration with Eloqua. This has prompted a change in business process for Leads - only 1 unique (email) Lead is allowed. This field has been added to compliment the Lead Source Title - containing the original lead source title value, this field will be updated with the most recent lead source title information.</description>
